# Feed Reader Project
The goal of this project was to be familiar with writing unit tests using the Jasmine library.

## Run the project localy

### Clone the code
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/Ilyes-Hammadi/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader.git
$ cd frontend-nanodegree-feedreader
```

### Run the local server
The following command will use the built in python server package to start a server on `127.0.0.1:8000` on your local machine
```shell
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
If you dont have python installed you just need to open `index.html` in your browser
